# Archive_Project

Overview

This repo contains some of the finding aids of the many archives belonging to the New Thinkers--a group of influental philosophers during the Weimar Republic in Germany. 


Scope 

The New Thinkers have been called "professional letter writers" because their archives containing thousands of letters written to each other and other notable thinkers during this era (including Freud, Benjamin, Tillich, Whitehead etc.). The aim of this project is to create a database for all their correspondence so that researchers can search, track and visualize this unique correspondence.  

The Archive Project was built on a MacOS system with python 3.10.1 and pip 22.0.4 in visual studio code. 

How to run this program: 

1) clone repo: https://github.com/sfbrenzel/Archive_Project.git

2) create a virtual environment: python3 -m venv venv

3) activate virtual environment: $ source venv/bin/activate 

4) install requirements: python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt 

5) Run Tables/New_Thinking_Search_Program.py


Code Louisville Requirements

Category 1: Python Programming Basics:
Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program.  

See New_Thinking_Search_Program.py


Category 2: Utilize External Data:
Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc, and use that data in your application.

See Tables folder


Category 3: Data Display
Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data.
Display data in tabular form

See New_Thinking_Search_Program.py
  

Category 4: Best Practices
The program should utilize a virtual environment and document library dependencies in a requirements.txt file.


Stretch Feature List 
Use pandas, matplotlib, and/or numpy to perform a data analysis project. Ingest 2 or more pieces of data, analyze that data in some manner, and display a new result to a graph, chart, or other display.
